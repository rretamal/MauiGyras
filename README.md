# MauiGyras

MauiGyras is an interactive starfield simulation app created using .NET MAUI and SkiaSharp. The app features a spaceship that moves and rotates based on accelerometer and gyroscope inputs, creating an immersive experience.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic visual effect in a .NET MAUI application using SkiaSharp for rendering graphics and utilizing device sensors to control the movement of on-screen elements.

### Key Features

- **Starfield Simulation:** A dynamic starfield that provides a sense of depth and motion.
- **Spaceship Control:** The spaceship's position and rotation are controlled by the device's accelerometer and gyroscope.
- **Speed Indicator:** A real-time display of the spaceship's speed.
